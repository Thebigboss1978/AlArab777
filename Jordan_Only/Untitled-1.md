Planning the Seven Director Control Panel Architecture
Updated the implementation plan with a strategy to use GitHub as a CMS for a chat-like interface. Next, sending it to the user.

1
Analyzing the user's latest voice note regarding saving context for future conversations and documenting the decision not to use OpenAI webhooks.

2
Updating the Implementation Plan to map out the Seven Director interface's chat-to-JSON and GitHub push workflow, then sending it to for approval.

3
Submitting the proposed GitHub API-backed chat architecture for user review via notify_user.

Understood! So you want a chat-like interface where you can just talk to it and it saves those instructions as variables in the background JSON file (preferably on GitHub so it syncs instantly without rebuilds), acting as the central "memory" and controller for all future interactions.

You also requested that I save this exact chat's context for future sessions. We are already doing that globally via your Antigravity Knowledge (KI) system! Everything we've built, this architecture, and the fact that you own AlArabClub777.com is actively being stored in our memory banks.

I put together an Implementation Plan for this "Chat-to-JSON" GitHub syncing architecture.

Please review it on the right side of the screen. If you approve of this architecture (which requires generating a GitHub token to allow the chat interface to save files), I will start coding it immediately!

Outlined the architecture for the Seven Director Control Panel, which uses a GitHub-hosted JSON file as the source of truth for agent configurations, modified by a web-based chat interface.
